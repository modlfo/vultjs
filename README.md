This is a fairly up-to-date JavaScript version of the Vult compiler that can be run with node.js.

You can find the full project in https://github.com/modlfo/vult

Tutorials and documentation can be found the main site http://modlfo.github.io/vult/

## Installing

You can install it with the following command

```
$ npm install vult -g
```

## Usage

After installing you should have an executable `vultc` which is the main Vult compiler. If `vultc` is not available, you can run the main JavaScript file (vultjs.js) with node.

Refer to the main repository to get more information about using Vult https://github.com/modlfo/vult
