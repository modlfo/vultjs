## Installing

You can install the command line application with the following command

```
$ npm install vult -g
```

You can install the library with

```
$ npm install vultlib

After installing you should have an executable `vultc` which is the main Vult compiler. If `vultc` is not available, you can run the main JavaScript file (vultc.js) with node.
